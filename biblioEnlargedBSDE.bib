These definitions extend the ones already given in the case of discrete-time processes. As in the discrete-time setup, continuous-time noncausality is a property concerned with the prediction horizon (global versus instantaneous noncausality) and the nature of the prediction (strong versus weak noncausality). Relations between the resulting continuous-time noncausality concepts are then studied for the class of decomposable semi-martingales, for which, in general, the weak instantaneous noncausality does not imply the strong global noncausality. The paper than characterizes these different concepts of noncausality in the cases of counting processes and Markov processes.},

The vector price process is given by a semimartingale of a certain class, and the general stochastic integral is used to represent capital gains. Within the framework of this model, we discuss the modern theory of contingent claim valuation, including the celebrated option pricing formula of Black and Scholes. It is shown that the security market is complete if and only if its vector price process has a certain martingale representation property. A multidimensional generalization of the Black-Scholes model is examined in some detail, and some other examples are discussed briefly.},

The default indicator is replaced by an appropriate prediction and the prediction error, that is the default-event surprise, is neglected. Our paper develops an approach to get closed-form expressions for the prices of credit derivatives written on multiple names without neglecting default-event surprises. The approach differs from the standard one, since the default counts cause the factor process under the risk-neutral probability Q, even if this is not the case under the historical probability. This implies that the default intensities under Q do not exist. A numerical illustration shows the potential magnitude of the mispricing when the surprise on credit events is neglected. We also illustrate the effect of the propagation of defaults on the prices of credit derivatives.},

  abstract={In order to derive closed-form expressions of the prices of credit derivatives, the standard models for credit risk usually price the default intensities but not the default events themselves. The default indicator is replaced by an appropriate prediction and the prediction error, that is the default-event surprise, is neglected. Our paper develops an approach to get closed-form expressions for the prices of credit derivatives written on multiple names without neglecting default-event surprises. The approach differs from the standard one, since the default counts cause the factor process under the risk-neutral probability Q, even if this is not the case under the historical probability. This implies that the default intensities under Q do not exist. A numerical illustration shows the potential magnitude of the mispricing when the surprise on credit events is neglected. We also illustrate the effect of the propagation of defaults on the prices of credit derivatives.},

abstract = {This book is intended as a textbook for Ph.D. students in finance and as a reference book for academics. It is written at an introductory level but includes detailed proofs and calculations as section appendices. It covers the classical results on single-period, discrete-time, and continuous-time models. It also treats various proposed explanations for the equity premium and risk-free rate puzzles: persistent heterogeneous idiosyncratic risks, internal habits, external habits, and recursive utility. Most of the book assumes rational behavior, but two topics important for behavioral finance are covered: heterogeneous beliefs and non-expected-utility preferences. There are also chapters on asymmetric information and production models. The book includes numerous exercises designed to provide practice with the concepts and also to introduce additional results. Each chapter concludes with a notes and references section that supplies references to additional developments in the field.},

By generalizing the existence result on partial differential and integral equations (PDIE) and Ito formula to the functions with only first and second Sobolev derivatives the probabilistic interpretation for solutions of \{PDIE\} (a new Feynman-Kac formula) by means of solutions of \{BSDE\} with jumps is got. With the help of this formula a new existence and uniqueness result for the solution of \{PDIE\} with non-Lipschitzian force is obtained. The convergence theorems of solutions to \{BSDE\} and \{PDIE\} are also derived. }

The notion of non-linear expectations has been studied only when the underlying filtration is given by a Brownian motion and in this work the filtration will be generated by both a Brownian motion and a Poisson random measure. We study at first backward stochastic differential equations driven by a Brownian motion and a Poisson random measure and then introduce the notions of f -expectations and of non-linear expectations in this set-up. }
